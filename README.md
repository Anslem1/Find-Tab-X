 You will need to run `npm install` to install all your dependencies. 
Create an `env` file in the root folder and include `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false` to make the extension work run
When all the dependencies are installed and env is ready, Go to the root of the project and `npm run build` to get started with the project. This create a build file to run since react doesnt run on exensions
